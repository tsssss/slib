This collection of IDL files allows you to access data from any Madrigal database directly from
within IDL.  

DOCUMENTATION

A good way to learn this API would be to run the example procedure
example_madidl.  Documentation of all public methods can be found in the file madidl.html.

For a background on the Madrigal database, go to http://madrigal.haystack.mit.edu/madrigal and
click on the documentation link.

INSTALLATION

All the included *.pro files must be on the IDL path.
