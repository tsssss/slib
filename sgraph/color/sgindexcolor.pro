; Type: pro.
; Purpose: Set current device to index color (decomposed=0).
; Parameters:
;   dev0, in, string, opt. The device to be set to index color mode. Default is
;       the current device.
; Keywords:
;   ct, in, int, opt. The color table. Do not load color table if no id is set.
;   file, in, string, opt. Set the file name of color table files, then ct is
;       the color table id in that file.
; Notes: none.
; Dependence: none.
